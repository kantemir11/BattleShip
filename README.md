Rules The ships are placed as follows:

1 ship — a row of 4 cells ("four-deck ships") 2 ships — a row of 3 cells ("three-deck ships") 3 ships — a row of 2 cells ("two-deck ships") 4 ships — 1 cell ("single-deck ships") When placing the ships, they must not touch each other by sides or corners.

When a player hits an enemy ship — a cross is placed on the enemy's field, and a dot is placed for a missed shot. A player who hits a ship shoots again.
